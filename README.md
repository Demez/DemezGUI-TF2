My own custom GUI and HUD for TF2, and will be VERY different from most other huds.

Once this is actually mostly finished, I plan to upload this to huds.tf

Might also be a mess since I don't really know what Im doing

Current Stuff Done (very general):
 - Modifed DemoUI
 - Main Menu Changes
 - Matchmaking Dashboard Changes
 - Matchmaking Panel Changes
 - Casual Gamemode Panel Changes
 
Currently Working On:
 - Side Panel For Finding a Game
 - Simple HUD that doesnt take too much of the screen, looks nice, and gives all the info you need easily (barely started)
Planned Stuff:

 - other more specific crap idk
 
I should show some images of current progress here, but ill do that later in 400 years.


I recommend using TortoiseGit if you want to easily keep this up to date
or you can use GitKraken if you actually don't know what your doing.
I don't recommend using github desktop as and freezes a lot, and is too limiting (for me at least).

My own custom GUI and HUD for TF2, and will be VERY different from most other huds.

Once this is actually mostly finished, I plan to upload this to huds.tf

Might also be a mess since I don't really know what Im doing

Current Stuff Done:
 - Modifed DemoUI
 
Planned Stuff:
 - Main Menu Changes (still working on design before i make it)
 - Simple HUD that doesnt take too much of the screen, looks nice, and gives all the info you need easily (barely started)
 - other more specific crap idk
 
I should some images so for the design plans here, but ill do that later in 400 years.


I recommend using TortoiseGit if you want to easily keep this up to date
or you can use GitKraken if you actually don't know what your doing.
I don't recommend using github desktop as and freezes a lot, and is too limiting (for me at least).
